## Topic Modelling L'encyclopedia
* topic classificaations were about 25% single-use
* topics were used to hide controversial articles and philosophical/political opinions
* reconciling editorial classification with automatic
* recomposition of categories (eg grouping different types of law into jurisprudence)

## Seeing the trees
* Jockers, 2012: "how do we mine texts to find something we don't already know?"
* http://www.tapor.ca/

###Â Questions
* No analysis of research questions
* Scalability in representations
* Balance clarity vs loss of detail
* Limitations of visual model 

## Trading Consequences

* pre-existing OCR'd text and Gazeteers
* Rare commodity information and terms
    * boot-strapped lexicon with historians' input (Klein et. al. 2014)
* If visualisations are the entry point, and deeper analysis is required how do we manifest those technically?
