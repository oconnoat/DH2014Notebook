## Ontology Alignment for Controversial Ontologies
* Got a group of semantic web students together who agreed a set of entities and properties as a group
* Then got them to make triple-based statements about those concepts, entities
* Voted agreement on all the statements for consent


## Annotation Motivation
(Presenting Author: @cutuchiqueno>

* Open Annotation Motivation inventory: <http://www.openannotation.org/spec/core/20130208/core.html#Motivations>
* Study on motivation, deconstructs annotation into three axes: <http://elk.library.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/26743/ubc_2010_fall_chiang_chianing.pdf?sequence=5>
* DARIAH Taxonomy of Research Activities: <https://github.com/dhtaxonomy/TaDiRAH>

* Annotation Environment <http://austese.net/>

### Remarks/Questions
* Modelling agreement problem and question about whether it aligns with user and what the app permits
* Annotation licensing and rights, especially for re-use


## SLSAH VRE
<http://www.dhlab.unibas.ch/index.php/de/forschung/salsah>

* Annotate rich items (manuscript images, regions of interest etc)
* Stores the data as RDF
    * uses stardog <http://stardog.com/>
* Access local and remotely hosted items
    * create proxy objects for externally-hosted items
* In-browser windows/desktop paradigm for multiple views
* Rich links
* Current issue: versioning and citability
    * Temporal RDF: considering either temporal annotation of statements, or explicit user-driven versioning
    * Changing something creates a new unit of information
* Distributed Storage &amp; preservation <http://distarnet.ch/>
### Remarks Questions
* What is the boundary of VREs? Institution, Markup, content?
* What is environmental about research environments?

## Semantic network of Dante's Works
<http://dante1.isti.cnr.it:8080/perunaenciclopediadantescadigitale/>
* Embeds XML Snippets in RDF

###Remarks &amp; Questions
* RDF doesn't handle text well
    * split the markup into that which RDF should cover (the things you want to reason over or understand) and the structural (which remains xml or html)
* If you permit user annotations and creation of triples by users, how do you avoid a mess?
    * RDF is a tool for materialising an already-existing consensus
