# Representation and Absence in Digital Resources

## Alistair Dunning

* 2 million pages, growing to 10 million
  * vanishingly small fraction of the amount of newspaper content that exists
* What users did &amp; didn't say:
  * annotation
  * datamining collections
* how to represent absence?
  * can't just use placeholders, as virtually every result would be almost all blank
  * may not even have the metadata for blanks, and hard to know when a blank is filled
    * google books goes by shelf
* OCR Quality
    * show the users a graph of how much content that they are throwing away by selecting different ocr thresholds

* Application for generating sample content http://samplegenerator.cloudapp.net/
* Interfaces built on the Austrialian Trove database http://wraggelabs.com/
* Nature Scientific Data http://www.nature.com/sdata/for-authors/submission-guidelines#format

## Welsh Newspapers User logs

* Search highly dominant to start sessions, but sessions increasingly browsed further in
* Often started at page 1 -- feature of page interface?
* high-point at 1840s and before ww1 (rating decade visits vs available resources)
* archive reading in real life is target-focused, digital libraries conflate multiple task aspects <http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263817>
* DH-related novel <http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538873-mr-penumbra-s-24-hour-bookstore>
