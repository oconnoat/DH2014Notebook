[Three Princes of Serendip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Princes_of_Serendip)

## [serendipomatic](http://serendipomatic.org/)

* in a hotel on a campus, isolated from the day to day
* need a range of skills, and to make sure that those people are keen
* the first project turned blog posts into a book
    * that was unsuccessful -- needed a lot of follow-up
* question of maintaining serendip-o-matic
* code an development as play
* don't keep user queries, only have google analytics
* do some citation tracking
* explicity stepped out of comfort zone
* new technical platform
* show, don't tell -- writing enticing copy
    * legibility and accessibility
* UX and design at the heart of the tool and how it would be use and received

## Randomness vs. Serendipity
* background vs. foreground 
* primary and secondary activities
* how much success is needed before it begins to count as valuable work?
    * laurie mccay-pete http://www.informationr.net/ir/16-3/paper483.html
* return aspect is under-emphasised
* noticing-stopping-capturing-returning

## STAKs
* camera eye tracking
* can elicit evidence of serendipity through task-oriented evaluations?
* algorithm for serendipity?
* combine a single interface for the physical and virtual resources
* multi-dimensional context of physicality (properties of the book, size, colour, position, touch)
* anxiety about incompleteness in a digital library is not seen in physical context?
* serendipity as a reconstructed notion that only occurs in the re-telling of the story?
